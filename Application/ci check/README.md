## Introduction

License scanning analyzes and identifies software licenses associated with code or components in a project. It helps ensure that the software you're using is compliant with the necessary legal and licensing requirements.

## Why License Scanning?

License scanning is essential for the following reasons:

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensures compliance with license terms and conditions.
- **OSS Management**: Identifies and manages licenses in open-source components.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies legal risks associated with specific licenses.
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Ensures compliance with license terms and safeguards your intellectual property.
- **Security and Quality Assurance**: Evaluates the security, quality, and reputation of components used in the project.

## License Scanning Tools

Here are some popular license scanning tools:
