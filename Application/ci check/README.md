## Introduction

License scanning checks the software used in a project to find out which licenses are attached to the code or components. It helps make sure that the software you’re using follows the legal rules and requirements of those licenses.

## Why License Scanning?

- **Legal Compliance**: Makes sure you’re following the rules of the software licenses.
- **Managing Open-Source Software (OSS)**: Helps track and manage the licenses of open-source components you use.
- **Risk Reduction**: Identifies potential legal issues related to certain licenses.
- **Protecting Your Work**: Ensures you’re following the rules to protect your own intellectual property.
- **Security and Quality**: Checks the security, quality, and trustworthiness of the components in your project.

## Tool Comparison

| Feature / Aspect        | FOSSA                             | Black Duck                        | FOSSology                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| License Detection       | Detects licenses across many languages | Detects licenses across multiple languages and package managers | Focuses mainly on source code license detection |
| Vulnerability Scanning  | Scans for open-source dependency issues | Identifies security vulnerabilities in open-source components | Primarily for license detection; no security scanning |
| Integration             | Works well with CI/CD tools and workflows | Integrates with popular DevOps tools | Supports custom integrations through APIs |
| Ease of Use             | Easy-to-use interface             | Mostly user-friendly              | Requires more technical knowledge |
| Community Support       | Active support with regular updates | Strong support from Synopsys     | Open-source with community-based support |
| Scalability             | Works for projects of all sizes   | Suited for enterprise-scale projects | Best for small to mid-sized projects |
| Customization           | Flexible reporting and policy options | Customizable policies and reports | Requires more technical work for customization |
| Cost (Free Elements)    | Free version with limited features | Mainly commercial, but offers trials | Free open-source version, but support may cost extra |


## Tool Recommendation

**FOSSA** is recommended for the following reasons:

- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Detects licenses across many different programming languages.
- **Security Scanning**: Effectively identifies potential security risks in your dependencies.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface and smooth integration with CI/CD tools.
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuously tracks license changes, helping maintain compliance over time.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| **Advantages**                                   | **Disadvantages**                                  |
